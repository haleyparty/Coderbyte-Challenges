# Coderbyte-Challenges
Tackling Coderbyte Challenge problems in Ruby

I'm looking to apply to coding bootcamps and ultimately switch careers from finance to web development, so I'm getting
some practice in with these challenges. Happy to hear anyone's feedback on how to refactor my code; always looking to learn!
Hope this is helpful to those who are stuck on challenges or looking for alternative solutions.
